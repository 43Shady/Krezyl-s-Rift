Krezyl's Rift Goofy Backstory You Do Not Care About

So abit of backstory behind this gane,
I think it was the 10th of January 2023, I was watching one of my favorite anime, Chainsaw man and an idea came to me. What if I made an action RPG game and I had tried to make games before but they didnt turn out well, To be fair Im not sure why I mentioned Chainsaw man because it had nothing to do with Krezyl's Rift. Fast Forward over to 4th Feb 2023 (Hopefully while im writing this) The game has been published for many people to enjoy, I really love the game I made from my "Undertale Fanboy Phase" When I was talking about undertale all the time It kind of got out of hand, 

Fun Fact- I made Krezyl's Rift on a 2014 Macbook Air

I also came up with the paper name 43Shady because I thought it sounded cool and so did my non existant friends.

Well thanks for reading
